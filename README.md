# visu

Visualizations on the HTML canvas and some quil experiments.

## Usage

Build the clojurescript files

```
lein cljsbuild once
```

Start the servers via

The client connects automatically with the websocket server, use the navigation menu to check the different visualizations. Unfortunately there are only two at the moment.
